# Fire-and-Smoke-Detection-using-Smart-Cameras
Smart Fire Detection uses a Raspberry Pi and YOLO (You Only Look Once) for real-time fire and smoke detection. Using trained datasets, the system achieves 92.8% confidence for fire and 85.1% for smoke, alerting authorities via Wi-Fi. Demonstrates IoT automation and machine learning versatility in safety monitoring.
